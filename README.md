# landing-page

This project was intended to practice Flexbox layout strategies while also formulating a passable web page. 

In the page, there are many generic attributes that any website would possess such as a header, footer, links, etc. ready to catch the eye of a prospective client.

This project was completed under the guidance of The Odin Project, under the Flexbox section.
